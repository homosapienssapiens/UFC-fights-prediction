This project will implement the training and testing of machine learning algorithms for UFC fight results prediction. The hypothesis is that the model can reach at least 80% of accuracy in itâ€™s predictions. When the training and testing phase are  complete the model will be tested live in UFC 246 Poirier vs McGregor on July 10th 2021 9:00 PM CDT
